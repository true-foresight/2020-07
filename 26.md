A forewarning about evolved persistent attack vectors and cybersecurity issues impacting industrialized nations that have hastily erected 5G communications network equipment.

## Dahaka
The previous set of biological and digital attacks that ravaged the world were identified with the code word - Corona. They were designed to totally eclipse the socio-economic and technological tenants of human civilization at a global scale. Trying to find the silver lining of such a total eclipse would only yield its corona and staring at it is blindingly unwise. 

Quite predictably, the people who were already oppressed and downtrodden before the 2019-2020 nCoV pandemic have nothing more to lose following the chaotic response from government and corporate agencies regarding ncovids. Telling such people that their lives and their contributions are "not essential" to society and then withholding their wages by furloughing them only further disparaged the disenfranchised. Such a stupefied global populace is obviously not interested in "reopening the economy" at the current stage of universally echoing bereavement because it was abandoned by its corporate and government "masters" to withstand the wake of a surreal requiem without sustainance. The 2020 pandemic phenomenon is merely a requiem for the entire human species that is currently stranded at the gates of oblivion. Yet, the victorian era overlords and slave owners masquerading as "elected officials" or "beloved leaders" want nothing more than their human resources to keep churning out profits for "making the world a better place" and to "go back to normality!"

Whose world? Better for whom and how? Why go back to normalized treachery and unbridled global pollution? 

We all live in a place where the waves of airborne biological viruses are going to stay here permanently and continue to evolve into superbugs. We all live in a place where the waves of internet borne digital viruses are going to stay here permanently and evolve into superbugs. We like to call this place earth - an abode for humanity and all living beings, a cradle for peace and love. Yet, the obvious thing in store for us, that I can notice with the clarity of conscience, strength of conviction and alacrity of thought intrinsic to me, is the coming of Dahaka.

Neither a soothing breeze to provide comfort under the blaze of a total eclipse's corona, nor a witty companion to succor the plight of the oppressed and weak proletariat; what is coming is the evolved versions of the 2016-2020 biochemical and digital attacks conducted in the name of "trade wars." These trade wars and proxy wars have already rampaged through Japan, South Korea, China, Singapore, Indonesia, India, Persia, Iraq, North Africa, Italy, Russia, Brazil and various other nations of the globe's Southern Hemisphere via logistical trade routes. Dahaka is simply the name of that harrowing wind which originates in the dead of winter from frozen and blighted petrochemical sands that will smite treacherous and fiendish "Westernized" first world countries like the U.S., U.K., Israel and Saudia Arabia!

Alas, that second wave of [stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet)-like advanced persistent threats via biochemical and digital pandemics will sweep through all of the world's countries because the world is round. What goes around, comes around! 

We can only pray at this time, in this era, that it shall pass us over, without causing us harm, or shredding our innate connection, to The Sacred. Amen.
