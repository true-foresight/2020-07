A foresight about socioeconomic unrest that poses supplychain risks for movement of goods and people. 

## White Crow Theory
A [black swan theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. Quite predictably many "experts" and "pundits" will come up with various rationalizations about how Covid-19 was a black swan event that exacerbated the issues of disenfranchised black people in poor communities sparking the Black Lives Matter movement. Of course, if anyone thought calling a person a ni---r and then stomping their throat while they choked to death was bad enough to generate worldwide riots wait till a poor refugee is called a terrorist and shot in broad daylight in front of his or her family. 

The humanity and personhood of a black person can be denigrated and delegitimized with slurs like ni---r. In a similar, or perhaps a worse way, the word *terrorist* is thrown around in various media to dehumanize people of Muslim and middle-eastern heritage. This is mainly done to make it justifiable and "sane" for police or military units to murder such individuals in foreign and domestic lands. Not recognizing a person as a human being allows militarized activities to conveniently wipe out "cultural misfits" and deny such people any human rights. More than racial purification, the current form of genocide is aimed at a tragic form of "cultural purification" to enforce a sense of being American or Canadian or British or German or Italian or Russian or Emirati or Indian or Chinese, etc. This type of warped nationalism currently uses methods like: 
  - chemical sterilization (e.g. plight of Uyghurs), 
  - punitive psychiatry (plight of Indigenous, refugee and immigrants in North America and Europe), 
  - indentured labor under a "citizen's" authority (plight of workers under H1B and other such visa programs), 
  - jail or dentention in a dehumanizing chamber without cause (plight of anyone seen as a misfit) and 
  - outright shootings and missile based bombings (were Palastinians and Syrians the first to come to your mind?)  

Once any migrant or refugee is thoroughly broken and brought to heal to an authority figure, they can be properly enslaved for exploitation! This is the simple formula for predatory capitalism that has existed throughout the world for centuries.  

To be put through socioeconomic hardships and then be labeled a terrorist is obviously not going to be received well by any person or community. It is worth noting that even though the word ni---r was censored in this document, the word terrorist was not because the world has already become too comfortable in branding someone or an entire ethnicity - barbarian, extremist or terrorist. It is easy to dismiss a person's worth as a human being in this form to commit heinous crimes against them that everyone else can turn away from to practice conformity and allegience to their lord. Would such a practice lead to riots by the oppressed? Or perhaps fullfledged cyberwarfare against corrupt officials, ministers and "the police" who were supposed to protect such vulnerable people from systematic oppression? 

We can call this type of anthropological forecast a white crow theory - the ability to surmise an entirely predictable event that comes as no surprise, has a major effect and will certainly be inappropriately rationalised after the fact by "experts" on 24h news channels.

Migrant lives are in a much worse situation than:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_sink">Calhoun's rats</a>.<br>
But still not as bad as the lives of people working for Amazon, Walmart or Tesla!
