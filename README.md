Let us consider the propagation of covid pandemic over the globe or in a swimming pool as a wave front. First let's see a wave function in a bounded region like that of a pool:
  - Reflection of water waves reflecting off a rectangular boundary - https://youtu.be/WRMhFUoPXyQ
  - A more complex simulation of water waves with reflection and diffraction against boundaries in shallow and deep water: https://youtu.be/A2auK5Sf4gY

So imagine human beings as particles on the globe's surface. As we bump back and forth into each other like particles, we send a wave of the *communicable disease* from one edge of the world to another. Physical boundaries and borders do mitigate some of the transmission of such a wave as seen in the simulation. However, these boundaries also contribute to "waves of reinfection" among the bounded particles. It can be noted that sparsely populated areas of the world would merely have a slower moving wave function of the pandemic. Naturally, densely populated areas would experience rapidly accelerating waves of infection and reinfection with refractory "wake forces" observed among the clustered particles. 

To visualize these particles as blobs or persons consider the following simulation videos:
  - Urban simulation, the city design within this cute sim is very typical of "western cities" - https://youtu.be/7OLpKqTriio
  - Global pandemic simulation via the game called "Plague" - https://youtu.be/3c152-PsES0?t=505

This type of analogy based reasoning with computer and game simulation is indeed very speculative. However, with this type of statistical input, one can better understand how the pandemic's spread and sociological effect of physical isolation will impact human resource management and industrial supply chains. 

Take for example the economic trend of working from home - the trending message of "stay at home" is not at all applicable to farmhands and other laborers who have no choice but to work in a close quarters production facility as in the meat packing industry. Coincidentally such workers are typically immigrants and ethnic minorities with lesser education. Such workers are told that they are "essential" but are payed *peanut shells* in comparision to the compensation their corporate bosses take. These manual laborers don't do essential work, they merely do unavoidable work in a classist society built on the principles of predatory capitalism. 

Our current predatory capitalism based society embodies the misinterpretation of the maxim, "survival of the fittest." The phrase, "survival of the fittest" isn't applicable to an organism, a person nor a species. It is applicable to a situation. The fittest situation that has continued to survive on earth since primordial times is physics itself and life embedded in a physical ecology of perpetual change. It is only natural within this ecology that a virus is at the bottom as well as the top of a circular food chain while being dispersed into every intermediate aspect of its entirety. As human beings we have now come to the rude awakening that we are not at the apex of some pyramidal model of the food chain. The worst disruption has been to our models of supply chains and business models for agro-products. 

Globalization and the "effectiveness" of the world economy depends squarely on manipulating currency exchanges and on sweat shops that supply cheap labor. With blockades set up for preventing human movement and travel the flow of: 
  - goods is mainly through few logistics corporations like Amazon, Fedex, etc. and 
  - services is mainly through communications corporations like Amazon, Google, AT&T, etc. 
  
It is only a matter of few months that the workers in these corporations crash because of overexploitation and hapless public polices disintegrate because nCoV has always been an airborne cerebral and mucal disease that can transmit via aerosols, dust, pollen, food, water and contact.

The long-term neurological impacts of nCoV infection are now being disclosed in July 2020 but were deliberately hidden by most governments in Nov-Dec 2019.

Here is an example of how people can be unfortunately dimwitted enough to assume that maintaining 2 meter distance next to a pool will somehow help in reducing the spread of the disease while jumping into the pool is supposedly a good idea. The advertisement shown below asserts that not maintaining 2 meter distance by the pool at all times is punishable by a year's imprisonment or $100,000. Maintaining such physical distancing is impossible within the confines of the pool area's entrance and the building's corridors. The building managers are ignorant of the fact that the mucous from the nose or mouth and other bodily fluids discharged into the pool are far more infectious than a possible sneeze or a cough. It is predictable that managers of private companies will leverage provisions about imprisonment and fines out of their zeal for predatory capitalism in the absence of appropriate public health information and disclosures from government agencies. 

These are some of the articles I found about the fine and imprisonment for not distancing: 
  - A news article - https://www.todocanada.ca/100000-in-fines-and-a-one-year-in-jail-if-you-violate-ontarios-covid-19-rules/
  - The actual verbiage of the emergency orders - https://www.ontario.ca/page/emergency-information and https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/200114
  - In general, "Fines for violating a provincial order under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act can range from $750 to $100,000, including up to one year in jail."

### Conclusion
**We can swim in a covid mucous infested pool but shouldn't stand around close together next to the pool:**
